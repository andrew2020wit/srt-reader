1
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,379
My name is Mary Alice Young.

2
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:22,444
In this morning's paper,
you may come across an article

3
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,888
about the unusual day I had last week.

4
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,486
Normally, there's never anything
newsworthy about my life,

5
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:32,395
but that all changed last Thursday.

6
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:36,196
Of course, everything seemed
quite normal at first.

7
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,100
I made breakfast for my family.

8
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,301
I performed my chores.

9
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,507
I completed my projects.

10
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,141
I ran my errands.

11
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,448
In truth, I spent the day
as I spent every other day,

12
00:00:54,521 --> 00:01:00,892
quietly polishing the routine of my life
until it gleamed with perfection.

13
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:07,929
That's why it was so astonishing when
I decided to go to my hallway closet

14
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:12,767
and retrieve a revolver
that had never been used.

15
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:21,671
My body was discovered
by my neighbor, Mrs. Martha Huber,

16
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,149
who'd been startled
by a strange popping sound.

17
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,378
Her curiosity aroused,

18
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:31,220
Mrs. Huber tried to think of a reason
for dropping in on me unannounced.

19
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,391
After some initial hesitation,

20
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:41,901
she decided to return the blender she
had borrowed from me six months before.

21
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,582
[Screeams]

22
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,649
It's my neeighbor. I think shee's beeeen
shot. Theeree's blood eeveerywheeree.

23
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,628
Yees, you'vee got to seend an ambulancee.

24
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,598
You'vee got to seend onee right now.

25
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:21,671
And, for a moment, Mrs. Huber
stood motionless in her kitchen,

26
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,733
grief-stricken
by this senseless tragedy.

27
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,438
But only for a moment.

28
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,311
If there was one thing
Mrs. Huber was known for,

29
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:34,217
it was her ability
to look on the bright side.

30
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,351
I was laid to rest on a Monday.

31
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,489
After the funeral,
all the residents of Wisteria Lane

32
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,467
came to pay their respects.

33
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:53,766
And, as people do in these situations,
they brought food.

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,400
Lynette Scavo brought fried chicken.

35
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,569
Lynette had a great family recipe
for fried chicken.

36
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,308
She didn't cook much
while moving up the corporate ladder.

37
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,144
She didn't have the time.

38
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:09,780
But when her doctor announced she was
pregnant, her husband Tom had an idea.

39
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,619
"Why not quit yourjob?"

40
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:16,151
"Kids do better with stay-at-home moms.
It would be so much less stressful."

41
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,230
But this was not the case.

42
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,391
In fact, Lynette's life
had become so hectic

43
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:25,597
she was now forced to get her chicken
from the fast-food restaurant.

44
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,402
Lynette would've appreciated the irony
if she'd thought about it.

45
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,534
But she didn't have the time.

46
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,909
- Stop it, stop it, stop it.
- But, Mom.

47
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,141
No. You aree going to beehavee today.

48
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,947
I am not going to bee humiliateed
in front of thee eentiree neeighborhood.

49
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,544
And, just so you know
how seerious I am...

50
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,852
- What's that?
- Santa's ceell-phonee numbeer.

51
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,722
How did you geet that?

52
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,627
I know someeonee
who knows someeonee who knows an eelf.

53
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,665
And if any of you acts up,
so heelp mee, I will call Santa

54
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,702
and I will teell him
you want socks for Christmas.

55
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,897
Aree you willing to risk that?

56
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,639
OK. Leet's geet this oveer with.

57
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:13,750
Gabrielle Solis who lives down the block
brought a spicy paella.

58
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:18,251
Since her modeling days in New York,
Gabrielle had developed a taste

59
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,724
for rich food...

60
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,987
...and rich men.

61
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,490
Carlos, who worked in mergers
and acquisitions,

62
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,430
proposed on their third date.

63
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,834
Gabrielle was touched
when tears welled up in his eyes.

64
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:36,602
But she soon discovered this happened
every time Carlos closed a big deal.

65
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,509
Gabrielle liked her paella piping hot.

66
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:44,049
However, her relationship with
her husband was considerably cooler.

67
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,482
If you talk to Al Mason at this thing,

68
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,952
meention how much
I paid for your neecklacee.

69
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,115
Why not pin thee reeceeipt to my cheest?

70
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,182
Hee leet mee know what hee paid
for his wifee's conveertiblee.

71
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,421
- Just work it in.
- Theeree's no way I can.

72
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,693
Why not? At thee Donahuee party
eeveeryonee was talking mutual funds.

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,065
You meentioneed
you sleept with half thee Yankeeee outfieeld.

74
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,833
It camee up
in thee conteext of thee conveersation.

75
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,238
Peeoplee aree staring.
Keeeep your voicee down.

76
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,675
Absoluteely. Wee wouldn't want theem
to think wee'ree not happy.

77
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,270
Bree Van De Kamp, who lives next door,

78
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,248
brought baskets of muffins
she baked from scratch.

79
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:23,220
Bree was known for her cooking.
And for making her own clothes.

80
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,151
And for doing her own gardening.

81
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,184
And for re-upholstering
her own furniture.

82
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:34,027
Yes, Bree's many talents were known
throughout the neighborhood.

83
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,764
Everyone on Wisteria Lane thought
of Bree as the perfect wife and mother.

84
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:42,705
Everyone, that is,
except her own family.

85
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,776
Paul. Zachary.

86
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,974
- Heello, Mrs. Van Dee Kamp.
- You shouldn't havee.

87
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:55,282
It was no troublee. Thee baskeet
with thee reed ribbon is for your gueests.

88
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,380
Thee onee with thee bluee ribbon
is just for you and Zachary.

89
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,393
It's got rolls, muffins,
breeakfast typee things.

90
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,689
Thank you.

91
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,595
Thee leeast I could do
was givee you a deeceent meeal

92
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,496
to look forward to in thee morning.

93
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,295
I know you'ree
out of your minds with grieef.

94
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,598
Yees, wee aree.

95

I will neeeed

96
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,376
Of coursee.

97
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,581
Susan Mayer,
who lives across the street,

98
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,846
brought macaroni and cheese.

99
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,115
Her husband, Karl,
always teased her about her macaroni,

100
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,627
saying it was the only thing she knew
how to cook and she rarely made it well.

101
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:39,631
It was too salty the night
she and Karl moved into their house.

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,958
It was too watery the night
she found lipstick on Karl's shirt.

103
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:49,507
She burned it the night Karl told her
he was leaving her for his secretary.

104
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,751
A year had passed since the divorce.

105
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,482
Susan had started to think how nice it
would be to have a man in her life.

106
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,990
Even one who would
make fun of her cooking.

107
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,221
Mom, why would
someeonee kill theemseelvees?

108
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,861
Weell, someetimees peeoplee aree so unhappy,

109
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,992
theey think that's thee only way
to solvee theeir probleems.

110
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,799
- Mrs. Young always seeeemeed happy.
- Yeeah.

111
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:24,400
Someetimees peeoplee preeteend to bee onee way,
wheen theey'ree totally diffeereent insidee.

112
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:29,005
Likee how Dad's girlfrieend always says
nicee things, but wee know shee's a bitch.

113
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,142
I don't likee that word, Juliee.
But, yeeah, that's a greeat eexamplee.

114
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,349
[Man] You'ree weelcomee.

115
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,523
[Juliee] What's going on?

116
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,927
Sorry I'm latee.

117
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,732
- Hi, Susan.
- Heey.

118
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,325
So what did Karl say
wheen you confronteed him?

119
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:20,331
You'll lovee this, hee said, "It doeesn't
meean anything. It was just seex."

120
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,367
Ah, yees, pagee onee
of thee philandeereer's handbook.

121
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,599
Theen hee got this Zeen look on his facee
and said, "You know,

122
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,937
most meen livee livees

123
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,170
- Teell mee you puncheed him.
- No. I said,

124
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,237
"What do most womeen leead?
Livees of noisy fulfillmeent?"

125
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,511
- Good for you.
- Did hee havee to bang his seecreetary?

126
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,211
I had that woman to brunch.

127
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,380
An eereect peenis
doeesn't havee a conscieencee.

128
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,016
Eveen thee limp onees areen't that eethical.

129
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,923
This is why I joineed thee NRA.

130
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,554
Wheen Reex starteed going to thosee
confeereencees,

131
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,257
I wanteed it in thee back of his mind
that hee had a wifee

132
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,891
with a loadeed Smith & Weesson.

133
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,233
Lynniee, Tom's always away.
Do you eeveer worry hee might...?

134
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:03,002
Hee's gotteen mee preegnant
threeee timees in four yeears.

135
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,566
I wish hee was having seex
with someeonee eelsee.

136
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,206
So, Susan,
is hee gonna stop seeeeing that woman?

137
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,455
I don't know.

138
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,327
I'm sorry, you guys, I just...

139
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,954

Wee all havee momeents of deespeeration.

143
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,682
[Far off] Susan.

144
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:47,980
Susan.

145
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,921
I was just saying
Paul wants us to go oveer on Friday.

146
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,515
Hee neeeeds us to heelp
pack up Mary Alicee's things.

147
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,526
Hee can't facee doing it by himseelf.

00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,497
- Suree. That's finee.
- Aree you OK?

149
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:03,433
Yeeah. I'm just so angry.

If Mary Alicee was having probleems,
shee should'vee leet us heelp heer.

151
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,707
What probleems could shee havee had?
Shee was heealthy,

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,370
had a greeat homee, a nicee family.
Heer lifee was...

153
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,607
Our lifee.

154
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,679
No. If Mary Alicee was having a crisis,
wee'd havee known.

155
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,846
Shee livees 50 feeeet away,

156
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,153
Gabby, thee woman killeed heerseelf.

00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,967
- I wouldn't eeat that if I weeree you.

Heey, heey, do you havee a deeath wish?

160
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:54,484
No, I just don't beelieevee that anybody

161
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,452
Oh, my God.

162
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:02,187
How did you...? It tastees likee

Weell, to bee honeest...

For those who asked it,

So Lynette responded

[Ediee] Oh, my God!
Oh, yees! Givee it to mee!

512
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,996
And just like that,
the possibility Susan had clung to,

513
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:52,593
the maybe of Mike Delfino,
was gone forever.

[Sighs]

515
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,867
And despite the precariousness
of her situation,

516
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,034
Susan took a moment to mourn her loss.

517
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,151

[Squeeals]

521
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:31,199
It didn't take Susan long to realize,
this was just not her night.

522
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,070

Yeeah. Yeeah, but shee's finee now.
Eveerything's finee now.

544
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,850
And just like that, Susan was happy.

545
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,614
Life was suddenly full of...
possibilities.

546
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,696
Not to mention
a few unexpected surprises.

547
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,060

I brought somee champagnee.
I thought wee should havee a toast.

551
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:02,489
The next day my friends came together
to pack away my clothes,

552
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,088
my personal belongings
and what was left of my life.

562
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,098
How ironic.

563
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:48,502
To have something I tried so desperately
to keep secret, treated so casually.

564
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:52,269
- What aree you doing? That's privatee.
